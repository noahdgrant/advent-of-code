# Advent of Code
This repo shows my work trying to help Santa and his elves save Christmas.

## 2024

In 2024, I did Advent of Code in Lua. I wanted to learn about configuring NeoVim
and this seemed like a good opportunity to learn the language behind that.

## 2023

In 2023, I did Advent of Code in Rust. I had heard lots about Rust in the months
leading up to Advent of Code and this was a good opportunity to learn. Rust quickly
became one of my favourite languages and I find any excuse I can to use it.
